# 5.Muffins_vs_Chihuahua
The other day, my girlfriend challenged me to make an AI that can differentiate between a muffin and a chihuahua. (It turned out to be surprisingly tricky) 

-set on hiatus cause it will say muffins to just about everything, will come and complete this later

plan is to make an executable that when run just changes a name of a file to the result
